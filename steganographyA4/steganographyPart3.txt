PREREQ: Please download both Question3.jpg and Question3_STEG.jpg to the same directory if you
plan on running the following command. I also supplised an example of the diff (run `cat diff_output.txt`) so you dont need 
to run the command yourself if you dont want to.

Rather than creating a program/script, I elected to simply run the following command:

    `binwalk -W Question3.jpg Question3_STEG.jpg"

This command outputs an easily digestible diff of the hex values for each of the files.
Afterwards manual inspection of the diff resulted in the discovery of one major pattern
that seems to be consistent across files generated by steghide. The pattern is the appearance
of the following continous line of bytes (encoded as utf-8):

    &'()*456789:CDEFGHIJSTUVWXYZcdefghijstuvwxyz

In the case of the images I provided, this string appears in the steg file twice, whereas the 
clean image doesnt have this string at all. As this string is highly structured and long
it can be a good indicator that a file has a hidden message contained within.
